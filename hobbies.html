    <h2>Gaming</h2>
    <p>
      Gaming has always been an exciting passtime for me, it is an activity that I utilize
      as just a relaxing exercise for the mind. It is also a great way to keep in touch with
      past friends and blow the dust off some old COD Black Ops Zombies, godly Minecraft worlds,
      or breaking out new and improved fps games. But I originally wanted to get into game
      developing as a possible occupation or side job.

      My mother collects pez dispensers and has more than enough, my father started both my brother
      and I on collecting Hess Trucks.

    <h2>Bowling</h2>
    <p>
      I have been Bowling for over 13 years and have won multiple tournaments as a youth bowler.
      In my highschool years I was the captain of the bowling team and even brought the team to
      nationals during our 2016-2017 season.
